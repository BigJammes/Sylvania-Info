 The race of Goblinoids refers to the goblins, hobgoblins, and ogres. These three races have lived in the lands of the modern day Khun territories for assumedly thousands of years. The first civilized settlers to reach the area roughly 2500 years ago noted that they had already built up a tribal civilization. These three races all feel a natural comfort in the Khun territories, and are noted to be stronger, faster, and even healthier while there. They do however suffer more and more the farther they travel from their homeland.
