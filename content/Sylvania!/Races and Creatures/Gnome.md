 Where did the Gnomes come from? *Gnome*-body knows! These little folks were first sighted around 1000 years ago, making them one of the newest races of Sylvania. If you ask a gnome where their race came from they will almost always not know. The gnomes do have one very unique quirk though, one day of the year the gnomes will all be able to conceptualize a mystical forest on the wester continent in the modern day territory of the [[Horsin Theocracy]] and express a desire to return there. Despite the efforts of scholars and explorers over the years this forest has never been found.
