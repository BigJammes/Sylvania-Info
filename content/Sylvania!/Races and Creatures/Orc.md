Orcs are another race that calls the Khun territories their home. These hearty creatures date their history to a migration from the south that occurred long ago, and claim to have settled with the Goblinoids afterwards. They are an honorable people, and have weapons made for them at birth which they keep until death. The orcs claim this is their way since as far back as their oral history goes. Orcs do not feel the same inability to leave the Khun territories as the Goblinoids, and tens of thousands now have begun to leave their homeland in search of adventure.
