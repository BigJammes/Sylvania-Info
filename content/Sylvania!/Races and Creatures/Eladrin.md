Creations of the Archfey to spite the genies' [[Genasi]] after the genies created the [[Changeling|Changelings]]. The Eladrin mimic the seasonal attributes of the Genasi, however the difference is that the Eladrin can change their seasonal attributes whenever they wish... with some minor setbacks. See, the Eladrin *can* change their seasonal attributes whenever they wish, the issue is that the Archfey failed to account for just how painful that drastic of a physical alteration would be. This has led to many Eladrin never altering their forms at all, as the pain they feel during it is often compared to that of childbirth.
