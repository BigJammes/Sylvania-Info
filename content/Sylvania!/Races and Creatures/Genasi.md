 People of the seasons, the Genasi were originally a collection of human tribes from the an area located in modern day Baria. They woshipped the seasons as well as the Genies, believing them to be the creators of the seasons. The genies, both as a joke and in an effort to keep up their trickery changed the tribes into Genasi. The Genasi later learned of this trickery after fighting in the war against the gods alongside the dragons 1400 years ago and ever since have had a race-wide disdain for the genies. Many Genasi keep small jars of their element with them at all times, and in the event of two genasi marrying, combine their jars to signify their unity.
