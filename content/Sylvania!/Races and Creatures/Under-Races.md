The Deep Gnomes, Drow, and Duergar all make up what is referred to as the Under-Races. These races are very similar to their above surface counterparts, but were severely punished by the god Lior after their revolt against the gods alongside the fey beings. Their punishment was banishment from the surface to the underground chasms and an extreme sensitivity to light. Many of the Under-Races that roam the surface wear hoods or use some other item to protect them from the sun's light.
