The original Assim were created after they managed to scale the highest mountain on the Eastern continent over 2000 years ago. To reward them for their determination, [[Gods|Trios]] gave them wings so that they may soar to new heights. His alter ego however then counteracted this gift by making the Aasimar terrified to travel beneath the planet's surface.
