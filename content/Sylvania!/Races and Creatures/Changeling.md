 Created by the Genies as a way to gain spies in the Archfey courts, Changelings have no true form. Their birth forms constantly shift and their features almost never remain the same for more than a day if they are not mimicking some other humanoid. This has caused them to be largely unwelcome in almost all societies in Sylvania, and those who have managed to be accepted still face distrust and unease from their peers. Changelings often wear visage masks that their parents design for them whenever they are not mimicking another's form. Due to the Thousands of years of distrust many changelings are genuinely scared to remove their masks, and don't even know what they look like without them.
