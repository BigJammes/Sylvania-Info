A very recent invention. Warforged use a magical intelligence matrix (M.I.M) to replicate sentience. At least their inventors say it is only a replication, the Warforged claim to be able to feel real emotions and many a debate about the ethics of creating Warforged has been prevalent in the more developed nations. Warforged notably require their MIMs to be recharged roughly once a year. They do this by either using M.I.M Charge Pack, or visiting paying a magically talented individual to channel magic into their M.I.M over roughly a one week period.
