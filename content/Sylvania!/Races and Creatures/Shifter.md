 A mix between Animas and Humans, the original shifters were created from a druidic sect that sold some of their humanity to Animeil in exchange for strength. This gave them the ability to shift their bodies to accommodate various animal-like features. The shifters are no longer tied to druids, but still hold nature in high regard, and are averse to living in large cities.
