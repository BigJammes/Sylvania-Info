 The descendants of the original Tiefin who were blinded as punishment after their war alongside the other fey beings 1400 years ago. They are naturally gifted with magic, and sport robust horns on their heads which they often will style similarly to how we style our hair. They have an innate fear of the dark and to combat the dark almost all Tiefling families have magical lamps that they wear to ward off the darkness. These lamps will typically have the family or house crest engraved on the bottom, and the quality of these lamps is seen as the main status symbol among Tieflings.
