Created by Liferia as one of the original three races before the 1st Calamity 4000 years ago. The elves boast extremely long lifespans of 600 years on average, and due to this are often in places of high political and societal importance. The downside is that many of the elves are extremely dull emotionally, after all after 300 years things sort of stop surprising you. Elves customarily will pick the name of their children by sprinkling a magical dust concentrate onto the baby roughly a week after birth. Somehow the baby then *knows* its own name, though nobody is exactly sure how this works.
