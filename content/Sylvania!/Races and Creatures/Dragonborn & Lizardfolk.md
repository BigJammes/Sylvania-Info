 Created by Animeil to spite the dragons after their defeat, the Dragonborn and Lizardfolk were both based off of the two different types of dragons prior to their change into humanoid forms. Both of these races were cursed from their creation by the gods to be completely unable to fly, but were given a form of infared vision as well by [[Gods|Animeil]]. However, some dragonborn have been known to develop wings as they grow extremely strong.
