Dwarves are one of the three original races known to have existed prior to the 1st calamity 4000 years ago. They are a hearty people, boasting incredible genetic strength for their size, as well as great skill in mining and metalwork. This has unfortunately led them to be rather averse to other trades such as tailoring or magic. Dwarves as a coming of age test in most places will create a metal ring which they will wear for life. It is considered the most important creation a dwarf will ever make.
