The Animas make up the humanoid animals who gained sentience after [[Gods|Animeil]] lost her duel against [[Gods|Nulis]]. These creatures began being referred to under the blanket term of Animas, but they themselves have many names for the countless different types. Examples include the rabbit people who call themselves Harengon, or the tortoise people who refer to themselves as Tortles, and even the Eagle like warriors from the far west, who refer to themselves as the Aarakocra. Regardless the other races for simplicity sake simply refer to all of these creatures as the Anima.
