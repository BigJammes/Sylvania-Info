The first of the original three races to be referenced in history, the first written records are from a human over 6000 years ago. Humans are a resilient people who are almost as different and varied as the Animas. They aren't really pulled in one direction and there have been plenty of famous scholars, warriors, wizards, etc. that were humans.
