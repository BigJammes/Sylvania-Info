Kobolds are similar to the gnomes in the sense that nobody really knows where they came from. Their physical features are similar to that of the Dragonborn and Lizardfolk, but all 3 races claim that they were created separately. Despite the odd circumstances many Kobolds have begun to integrate into modern societies at a rapid rate, and are currently the fastest growing race on the western continent.
