# Summary (Courtesy of James)
Upon entering Eretrona, our party made contact with the villagers. They immediately made contact with a man named Halwin Drenn, and he began to explain what has been occurring with the villagers. He explained that he wanted to accompany the party on their journey to acquire a ship to leave the island to Hayes. Though apprehensive, Hayes said he would bring it up to the group. Halwin offers any resources the village can spare as payment for assistance in clearing out the pirates. Meanwhile, Damseol searched the village for new robes and some dye, this was so she could change Aurelius' appearance after finding a worrying note on Olvar that spoke of William wanting to question him. Vrynn and Wouldy go straight to sleep in two of the vacant houses. Eventually, Hayes goes to search for food and decided to ask Halwin where the food is kept. Upon finding him Hayes discovers Aurelius speaking with Halwin, Aurelius then explained that the villagers would likely die without their aid, and could at least not slow them down *too* much. Afterwards, Olvar awoke from his sleep and was interrogated. The group learned lots of information from him, and afterwards Olvar requested to be killed in a battle. So, he grabbed his weapon with supervision, and Clint struck him down upon charging him. After this the group slept and gathered supplies for the trek in the morning. The group also decided to take the villagers with them, as they had various services they could provide, as well as a way to shorten their journey. The now much larger group then set out for the lake on Eretrona to attempt to regroup with the Iron Corsairs, and found them in a tense battle with pirates, as well as a pirate lieutenant named Esther who was mentioned in the note from Olvar. The party did battle with the pirates and came out on top.
