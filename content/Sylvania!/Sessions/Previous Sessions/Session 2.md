# Summary (Courtesy of Kit)
While trying to find supplies nearby, Vrynn and Damseol stumbled across Aurelius, the scholar who was leading the expedition, lying injured in the brush. Vrynn is able to heal him and he tells them about how he was attacked by small hooded figures speaking a strange language who stole his spellbooks, along with all the documents and money they were going to use on the island. Once they regrouped, Hayes was able to recognize the language they spoke as "draconic" and the creatures as likely being kobolds. Aurelius tells them he can lead them to the kobolds so they can retrieve the items and asks them to help. The party agrees, except for Clint, who decides to go ahead to town and meet them later for the ambush. As they're getting ready, Damseol nervously explains to the party that she has a pact and her patron takes her vision every night, but she will try to negotiate. Hayes agrees to carry her as she goes unconscious and communes with her patron who cautions her against continuing to fight and urges her to leave, but agrees to let her have her vision for the night in exchange for paying back the lost time over the next few days. He also tells her that Whitehair owes a friend of his and if need be, Damseol can remind him of his debt.

Once they arrive in the kobold camp, Woody and Vrynn sneak off to ambush the kobolds in case things go south, while Damseol and Hayes attempt to con the kobolds into trading Aurelius' notebooks for Damseol's amulet. Aurelius poorly hides behind a wall. As the negotiation breaks down, Hayes notices the fruity looking head kobold with a nipple piercing seems to be using some kind of earring to take orders. After he attacks a nearby kobold, a fight begins and the kobolds counter-ambush the party, taking Aurelius down. During the fight, Woody ends up isolated from the party and has to hold his own against the kobolds ganging up on him. Vrynn is able to fend off the kobolds ambushing him and prevent Aurelius from rushing his way to the afterlife. Damseol almost dies, but is able to turn the tide of the fight in their favor by sniping off the kobold mages. After charging the fruity kobold, Hayes is close enough to notice that his earring is of draconic make. It pisses him off and instead of attacking him he rips the earring off his head, severing his connection to whoever was giving him instructions. Seeing most of their friends dead, the remaining kobolds surrender. Hayes, along with Aurelius who is of very little help, interrogates the survivors and learns that they live in underground tunnels that connect this part of the island to the main tunnels. Recently they were conquered by a dragonborn who gave them specific instructions to attack Aurelius in exchange for "shinies", one of which is a gold necklace Aurelius is able to identify as giving a spellcaster an extra level one spell slot once a day. He reminds Hayes he can use it but Hayes reminds him he has rolled above a 10 once this entire session and doesn't deserve it. Once they have all the information they need, Hayes executes the kobolds and the party, most of whom are done looting the dead kobolds, begin heading towards town.
