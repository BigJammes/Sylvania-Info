# Summary
The party has met at the capital of the Merchant Kingdom of Wartontia, Halter. They were briefed by the king on the mission they will be doing, and fed a nice meal to prepare them for their journey. After this they began their journey to the island of Essia to begin their adventure. During this trip they met the Iron Corsairs and their leader, Merric Flintbeard, who had a brief spar with Clint and gambled with Wouldy. The party was then forced to abandon ship and fled to the nearby smaller island along the Essian gulf, home to the village of Eretrona. They agreed to regroup with Merric and his group at a small lake on the island. The party were immediately set upon by pirates, who were quickly dispatched of. They decided to leave one pirate alive and interrogated him to gather information and discovered that another pirate called Oscar who works under William White Hair is present on Eretrona raiding the area for supplies to bring back to the mainland. With this knowledge the party devised a plan to use their newfound pirate lackey to lure out pirates in the nearby village of Eretrona and take them out. Then ultimately move northward to deal with Oscar and resume their trip to the main Isle of Essia.
