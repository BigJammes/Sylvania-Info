# Summary (Courtesy of James)
After regrouping with Clint, the party sets an ambush for the pirates inside of Eretrona with the aid of Pirate #4. In what became an extremely tense battle between the leader Olvar and the party, our heroes eventually came out on top. After the battle, Olvar was subdued and the party began to travel into Eretrona to rest for the night. Olvar also had multiple different artifacts that the party took. Olvar also had a note that Damseol took.
