 Here are a collection of homebrew rules I like to use in my campaigns. If you have any questions about these rules please let me know. I'll go over these rules in session 0.

- Health potions are a bonus action to use on yourself and an action to use on someone else, and I have a personalized setup for how the healing is determined. 4 tiers, diluted/weak, normal, potent, and invigorating.
	- Diluted Health potion: grants health equivalent to your hit dice + con mod halved
	- Normal Health potion: grants health equivalent to your hit dice + con mod
	- Potent Health potion: grants health equivalent to two hit dice + con mod + total level
	- Invigorating Health potion: grants same health as potent health potion, also grants temp hp equal to you're hit dice + con mod. 
- Health potions grant the maximum amount of healing when used outside of combat, same goes for healing spells.
- Opportunity attacks do the maximum possible damage if they land, this encourages you to really think about positioning as it is far riskier to take an opportunity attack
- Short rests will require a minimum of 1 full hour of rest with minimal activity and stress
- Long rests require you to have a safe environment, food and drink, and a minimum of 6-8 hours of sleep depending on the comfort level of the rest site. (I.e less time in a fancy hotel than a camp in a forest)
- High ground grants the benefit of half cover against enemies at least 10 feet or more beneath you
- The dodge action is replaced with taking a "defensive stance" which requires a bonus action and consumes half of your total movement. Doing so means you cannot use any hostile actions or spells against enemies (this includes de-buff spells that do not do damage). You *can* however still use your action on beneficial spells for you or your party members (such as healing spells or buff spells). If you have a continuous hostile spell active (such as spirit guardians) taking a defensive stance will automatically end concentration on it.
- Depending on your selected background, certain interactions will be easier or harder for you (basically I give extra info or withhold info depending on background)
- We will be using a lingering wounds/injuries system. The full outline of this can be seen here*.
