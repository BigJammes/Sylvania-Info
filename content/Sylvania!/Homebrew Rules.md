 Here are a collection of homebrew rules I like to use in my campaigns. If you have any questions about these rules please let me know. I'll go over these rules in session 0.

- Health potions are a bonus action to use on yourself and an action to use on someone else, and I have a personalized setup for how the healing is determined. 4 tiers, diluted/weak, normal, potent, and invigorating.
	- Diluted Health potion: grants health equivalent to your hit dice + con mod halved
	- Normal Health potion: grants health equivalent to your hit dice + con mod
	- Potent Health potion: grants health equivalent to two hit dice + con mod + total level
	- Invigorating Health potion: grants same health as potent health potion, also grants temp hp equal to you're hit dice + con mod. 
- Health potions grant the maximum amount of healing when used outside of combat, same goes for healing spells.
- Opportunity attacks do the maximum possible damage if they land, this encourages you to really think about positioning as it is far riskier to take an opportunity attack
- Short rests will require a minimum of 1 full hour of rest with minimal activity and stress
- Long rests require you to have a safe environment, food and drink, and a minimum of 6-8 hours of sleep depending on the comfort level of the rest site. (I.e less time in a fancy hotel than a camp in a forest)
- High ground grants the benefit of half cover against enemies at least 10 feet or more beneath you
- The dodge action is replaced with taking a "defensive stance" which requires a bonus action and consumes half of your total movement. Doing so means you cannot use any hostile actions or spells against enemies (this includes de-buff spells that do not do damage). You *can* however still use your action on beneficial spells for you or your party members (such as healing spells or buff spells). If you have a continuous hostile spell active (such as spirit guardians) taking a defensive stance will automatically end concentration on it.
- Depending on your selected background, certain interactions will be easier or harder for you (basically I give extra info or withhold info depending on background)
- We will be using a modified version of the lingering wounds/injuries system (I stole it from Kira). The full outline of this can be seen here* and the changes to the system are listed below. 
	- You will not be required to make a CON save on your first time being downed, and will never make a save with disadvantage.
	- Injuries (unless it is directly specified in this list otherwise) can be removed via magical healing depending on their level. (1st level healing for minor injuries, 3rd level for intermediate injuries, and 5th level for major injuries with exceptions listed below).
	- For major injuries that involve the severing of a limb or appendage, the limb MUST be present and in good condition for it to be healed and re-attached using magical healing of 5th level. If the limb or appendage is not present the 7th level spell "regenerate" will be required to heal said wound.
