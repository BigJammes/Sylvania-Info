# Timior
God of time and history. Considered to be the wisest god among the 10 siblings. His domain is a library with all writing, music, and other things stored for his followers to study for eternity. He is known to actively encourage his followers to pursue the discovery of new concepts and ideas, even at the cost of others or the world itself. He was the main advocate for allowing the dragons to be allowed to live.
# Venseil
Goddess of Vengeance and Karma. If you are a good person you will be rewarded by Venseil, and if you are wronged it is theorized that Venseil is the main motivating factor that whispers for you to take vengeance. Her followers often appear after death as her agents that enact her vengeance upon those who harm her or her followers. Venseil is by far the most protective of her followers, but is also somewhat possessive and obsessive.
# Liferia
Goddess of Life and Stagnation. While this god is the main force behind new biological creations, births, and more, she is also the patron god and the creator of liches and vampires. She despises the idea of death, and actively works against Warun to try and create ways her followers can live forever. She is equally the patron of most druids, and encourages her followers to respect nature and to preserve it to the best of their abilities.
# Warun
God of Death and Finality. The opposite of Liferia, Warun is the one who establishes the lifespans of the races (races with longer lifespans have them because Liferia created them to be more resistant to Warun's influence) and who plans for the end of all things. His followers attest that it is good for things to end, as that also allows for new things to begin. Warun actually does not dislike Liferia, as he understands that they need one another for the world to function.
# Gotch
God of Acceptance and the Outcasts. Gotch shelters and accepts those who society has cast out. The weak and unloved, the sick and untreatable, these are the people who primarily make up Gotch's followers. Gotch is also credited by the goblinoid races as their creator. Gotch has a somewhat possessive personality similar to Venseil, and thus subconsciously dissuades his creations from leaving their homeland.
# Crafios
God of Craftsmanship. One of the few gods who break the typical pattern of duality, largely due to his relatively simple premise. He encourages his followers to create newer and better inventions, tools, weapons, whatever can be created! Even if those things cause mass harm...
# Lior
God of Light and Truth. Lior is often noted to be brutally honest to others, to the point of actually pushing lots of people away from him. He rules over the light and created the concept of day and night alongside his sister Dior. Revealing of truths and lighting the darkness are the goals of his paladins and clerics, even if the truth is best left unknown or the darkness best left unexplored.
# Dior
Goddess of Darkness and Deception. If you've ever told a lie the Dior is smiling down on you from his domain. Dior embodies the importance of darkness and the concept of hiding things and deception. Her followers work tirelessly to protect the world from the most dangerous of truths, obscuring them in darkness so thick it is nearly impenetrable.
# Nulis
Goddess of War and Honor. Nulis loves to fight. War and honorable duels are her bread and butter. Duels are sworn to Nulis to honor fairness and most competitions credit Nulis as their patron. Nulis doesn't really care why the fight is happening or who it hurts and kills, only that it is fair.
# Animeil
Goddess of Animals and Nature. Animeil is the embodiment of nature conservation, and granted many animals humanoid forms and sentience after being forced to by Nulis after a duel. Her creations range from the Lizardfolk to the Harengons and everything in between. She despises industrialization and destruction of nature, regardless of its necessity for the progression of society.
# Magius
God of Magic. All forms of magic currently present in Sylvania owe their existence to Magius, who created the laws by which magical energy can manifest into spells. Magius encourages his followers to pursue magical innovation in all aspects regardless of the consequences. Many a magical calamity were caused by Magius' most devout followers.
# Trios
God of Triumph and Defeat. Trios is the idea of perseverance and grit. The unwillingness to give up and to push on and succeed at anything regardless of circumstance. He also however is the first to quit, to admit that the challenge is too much and allow himself to fail. Which of the two is present on any given day is a toss up, and many of his followers often find themselves comforting him during his days of defeat.
