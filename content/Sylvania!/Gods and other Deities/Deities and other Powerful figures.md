# Dragons
The dragons reside in the territory known as Perscombe, and are protected by a fervent cult of followers. They are cursed to reside in mostly humanoid forms after being subjugated by the gods over 2000 years ago. They were also cursed with the inability to reproduce with one another. They are the only creatures alive that remember the old world.

# Genies
Dealmakers of the Feywild. Genies are the creators of Genasi and are known for being quite self-centered. They make deals with mortals of all walks of life and often cause great mischief and mayhem in the process. The number of total genies is unknown but it is estimated by fey scholars to be around 50 total, though there is evidence that there were at one point over 100 different genies.

# Archfey
The official rulers of the feywild and creators of the fey mark which allows for travel inside of the plane. With power rivaling that of some of the weaker gods these beings are not to be trifled with and have attracted a surprising amount of cooperation with the elves, much to [[Gods|Liferia's]] dismay. The Races of the fey enjoy longer lives thanks to the efforts of the Archfey, who learned how to replicate the magics of [[Gods|Liferia]] and use them to extend the lifespans of their own creations.

# Tiefin
These creatures are the remnants of the original Tieflings, and are undying as long as they remain within the feywild. Their descendants unfortunately do not have this benefit, and have a lifespan of roughly 150 years. During the war against the gods they were caused to lose their sight completely, and due to this their descendants are terrified of total darkness. This paranoia has led to most if not all Tiefling families using magical lamps created by the Tiefin to always have a way to ward off darkness.
