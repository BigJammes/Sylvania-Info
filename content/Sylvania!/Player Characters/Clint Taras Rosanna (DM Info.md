# Backstory
Clint T. Rosanna, the self proclaimed “Swordsman of 100 Blind Battles”. Clint was raised in a small village with no name off the coast of Kewicland. He was born to his mother, Ravi Rosanna. His mother was one of the few warriors of the small village, named the Taras. She was amongst the higher ups in the village. The Taras would intermittently join the overall Kewicland military especially for important deployments. On one of these deployments is where Ravi would have Clint, she would come back from deployment months before any of the other soldiers would, baby in hand. She would go into a coma for months after reaching the village gates, and after a year would be declared in a vegetative state. The only sign of life that would come from her was if you ever brought Clint near her, her arm would just barely twitch towards the direction of him.

Clint was almost immediately seen as a bad omen, he was incredibly large for his young age, at age 2 he was the size of a 5 year old. However the village would do test after test, but they couldn’t determine anything other than human in his blood, these tests would leave a lasting autopsy-like scar across his chest. He would be passed around from village person to village person, no family ever wanting to hold onto him for long. Thus he never had any form of friends or education. Strangely enough however, and annoyingly enough for the village people who attempted to ostracise him, it never seemed to affect him much at all.

Eventually he had grown to around 5’6 by age 9, and was incredibly big, and his hair was a silver colour. The villagers would start seeing a use in keeping him around. They would start training him, putting him on much too strict a regimen for someone his age. They expected him to run away or simply waste away, but he survived, and the training actually worked. But as they saw him get stronger and stronger they realised the horrible possibility that Clint realise how they treat him and attack the village. Thus they sent him away to someone named the “Tarasmother”. Clint would make the week long journey up the large mountain towards the Tarasmothers house at just age 13.

He would then finally see a small cottage atop the mountain, immediately he would be attacked by a masked figure in full samurai armour, holding two scimitars. The only thing to defend himself being a spear made from a wolf fang and a large branch. Surprisingly he would be able to hold his own, for about 5 minutes before being knocked unconscious. Waking up at a small table in a small house with a bowl of soup in front of him.

The Tarasmother was an old human woman, she was one of the strongest warriors the village had ever known, but would be exiled from the village for unknown reasons. She would take in Clint and treat him like no other had, like the child he actually was. Unfortunately he had long past grown the age where he could be taught anything other than basic Sign Language, as the Tarasmother had gone deaf in one ear in her old age. As for actual education, no matter how much the Tarasmother tried, he couldn't understand.

The Tarasmother would then pivot, if he couldn’t become a scholar then she would just have to lean into him becoming a warrior. From age 13 to 14 Clint was forced to wear a blindfold 24/7, to develop a basic awareness of things around him without being able to see anything. From age 14-15 he would learn basic fighting with a double bladed scimitar, adding another double bladed scimitar from 15-16. Then he would learn to combine the two skills, learning how to fight blind. Most would see this as a borderline insane way to learn, giving up one of the most valuable senses a human could possess, but Clint didn’t know any better, thus he put 100% into it. By age 17 he was 6’10, a giant amongst humans. Finally from 17-18  Clint would hone all his learnt skills and be sent off to the military. 

Age 18-20 was a blur for him, the military would constantly send him on task after task, essentially becoming a pack mule for them, carrying large amounts of supplies from town to town. But something would pique his interest. The military would very quickly realise he wasn’t the smartest, thus superiors and others wouldn’t be careful about holding their tongue around him, thus he had started hearing stories of a special elixir, one that could cure anyone of any ailment, thinking of his mother he would start a silent quest of asking about it from town to town. At the very least he was able to confirm it wasn’t a complete lie, but got no leads as to where it could be.

Eventually his required service would end and he would return to the Tarasmother, only to find her on her dying breaths. He would rush to her side, she wouldn’t say much, other than to go into her room and into the attic. He would stay by her side until her dying breath, before following her instructions. He would find her old armour, adjusted and fixed to be his size, and 2 incredibly beautiful and ornate double-bladed scimitars. He would take these and add the name Taras to his own, finally returning to the village after 7 years.

At first the village would immediately assume they were being raided. Clint wouldn’t notice as the townsfolk would cower in their homes as he passed through the town, no soldier daring to even approach. He would make his way to the family home, where his mother was. He would enter the home, to the dismay of the healers tending to his mother. They would cower as Clint approached his mother. By this point her eyes were open, glazed over, but open. She would eat basic foods but still wouldn’t speak or move beyond that. But the doctors would realise who the large mysterious man was, as Clint entered the room and for the first time in years, Ravi’s eyes would look towards Clint, focusing for the first time. And her arm would fully reach for his, grabbing his large hand.

Clint would spend the next couple of hours with his mother, silent as onlookers would peer into the house. He would undo his blindfold and mask to look at her, confirming to the townsfolk who he was. Confirming she was alive he would finally leave the home. He would ask the townsfolk for some supplies, he knew the town hated him, it took him a while but he had figured that out. But surprisingly they listened, though most likely due to fear of him lashing out. He vowed to only return to the village once he had found the Cure-All Elixir, and left without another word to anyone else.

The next 4 years of his life would be spent wandering, trying to find anything about this elixir.

  

/Extra Stuff/

  

His mother, Ravi Rosanna is around 6’0 with raven hair that falls to around her waist. When she was a warrior she was incredibly muscular, but now is quite gaunt. Her once tanned skin has turned much paler and her green eyes have grown saturated.

  

The Tarasmother never gave Clint her real name.

  

The Tarasmother never told Clint why she was exiled.

  

Nobody knows who Clint’s father is, Clint never gave it much thought.

## DM Ideas

	The Tarasmother and Ravi might have had some kind of relationship
	Ravi maybe made a deal to revive Clint after he was stillborn
	Tarasmother may have helped with this, or been the one to propose the idea
	Come up with something for Clint's dad

Either the Tarasmother or Clint's mom are his connection to the prophecy
