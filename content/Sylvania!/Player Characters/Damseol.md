Damseol is a tiefling that stands at 5’2” and weighs about 120lbs with mid length black hair that is braided into twin braids that are chest length and two short dull horns at the top of her head that have been filed down. She has light pink skin and orange eyes that are accompanied with both deep set eye bags and two dots tattooed underneath. She is currently wearing a peach colored halter dress with a pastel yellow corset belt with a pastel green bow and embellishments that lay on top, but she does consistently change her wardrobe according to the season with clothes she makes herself. She also has, attached to her hip, a medium sized iron lantern that is always magically emitting orange light and that has a red bow and is tied to the very bottom of it, Occasionally the panels of her lantern are adorned with handmade stickers that change according to the season.
