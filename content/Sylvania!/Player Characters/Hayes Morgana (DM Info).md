Physical Traits

  

- 38 (just a baby really, 19-20 as a human)
    
- Half elf half black dragon
    
- 6’9”, 6’11” with the horns
    
- Tan, warm undertones
    
- Dark grey eyes
    
- Horns and tail of a black dragon
    
- Scale cover his arms and parts of his shoulders and ears
    
- Broad in the shoulders but a little lanky overall, still a growing boy
    
- Clothing and gear are all “standard issue” but well maintained 
    

  

Early Life  
  

- Born into a dragon worshipping cult
    
- Raised with the intention of eventually taking a leadership position (equivalent education to a nobleman’s son, but more biased)
    
- Treated well, but like a precious object
    
- Rarely saw and little relationship with biological parents 
    
- You can make up most of their details and why he was born, he’s probably not completely sure himself
    
- Only companion growing up was his younger sister (Kei), two of them were very close 
    
- Grew discontented with lack of freedom as he grew older, ran away when he saw the chance 
    
- Feels guilty for abandoning his sister, plans to return and break her out
    

  

Bosford

  

- Hitchhiked to the capital of Bosford from Perscombe, probably by offering his services as a basic mercenary/guard/magic user 
    
- In Bosford, was offered aid by a paladin of Venseil named Zena, the two of them ended up becoming friends with her convincing him to become a paladin of Venseil
    
- Zena headed an expedition to provide aid/conversion to citizens of the islands almost 2 years ago, they lost contact with that group ~7 months ago
    
- Petitioned the Order to go after them and hightailed it to Essia
    

  

Personality/Ideals 

  

- Very proud, edging into arrogant 
    
- Not so proud he can’t see other people as being better or stronger than him, but in his worldview he is more capable than most people and therefore better 
    
- Has a bit of a hero complex, since he is strong it is his job to fix things
    
- Thrill seeker/adrenaline junkie, enjoys dangerous situations  
    
- Emotionally stunted, bad at relationships and mostly gets through social interactions by being charming and knowing what to say 
    
- Views dragonborn/lizardfolk as being pathetic, in a “it’s kind of sad you literally exist as a joke/lesser version of me” kind of way 
    
- Disagrees with how he was raised but might not really see it as bad/a cult
    
- Doesn’t really view either the dragons/gods as right or wrong, kind of lazzari-faire about everything and happy to work with Venseil as long as she’s a beneficial patron 
    

  
  

Important Relationships: 

  

Morgana (Mother)

- Medium height, curvy, grey eyes, long wavy black hair
    

- Kind of scared of her 
    
- Interacted with her less, but she treated him a bit more as a child/person 
    
- Respects her ambition but thinks it’s kinda useless
    
- I think he vaguely knows she has some kind of plan and thats why he exists, but no more details
    
- Prefers her by a narrow margin 
    

  

Felaern (Father)

- Taller, average leaning skinny build, blue eyes, long white hair
    

- Thinks he’s a mega nerd and kind of silly 
    
- He generally took care of them more, but he doesn’t rlly view them as children, much less *his* children
    
- Mostly did testing on them to document the growth and traits of the first ever humanoid-dragon hybrids
    

  

Kei (Sister)

- 5’6” as a human, idk what that is in elf height, blue-grey eyes, long straight black hair, paler than Hayes is 
    

- His baby sister, would die for her
    
- Literally the only person he had to talk to for 25 years
    
- Very protective of Kei, would probably lose his shit and immediately drop anything he was currently doing to try and save her if he thought she was in danger
    
- Kei is more introverted and quiet, preferring to usually read by herself, talks softly in a flat tone
    
- Due to their lack of other people to socialize with and Hayes being the older sibling, she has a habit of imitating him 
    

  

Zena

- Tiefling, 5’2”, red skin + medium length maroon hair, ram’s horns
    
- Comes from a family of blacksmiths 
    
- Generally a very happy and cheerful person, but angers quickly and will passionately fight if its something she cares about 
    
- Idealistic to a fault, very earnestly believes that joining Venseil is the best choice and everyone should do it
    

Hayes has a massive teeny crush on her, she also likes him but doesn’t view it as super important and thinks duty comes first**

## DM Ideas
	Figure up what to do with Zena (Venseil paladin that Hayes is friends with)
