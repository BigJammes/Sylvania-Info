Vrynn was born to a Goliath father and an elven mother he never knew, raised by the mountain Goliaths after his mother disappeared. From the beginning, he was seen as lesser and weaker—always marked by his elven blood. The Goliaths valued strength and endurance, and while his elven heritage set him apart, Vrynn refused to let it define him. Despite being judged, he worked harder than his peers, striving to prove himself strong and capable in every way.

  

The day before a major raid, Vrynn overheard the Goliath leaders speaking in hushed tones. To his shock, they knew where his mother was from—and what her current whereabouts are. She was a druid, researching a new artifact that, among other things, seemed to enhance nature in the region nearby. They had chosen not to share this with him, fearing that if they did, he might leave the tribe to search for her. The revelation stung deeply, a reminder of the rejection he had always felt and the secrets that had kept him in the shadows of the tribe.

  

During a raid into ancient ruins, the tribe stumbled upon an ancient temple covered in strange designs and ominous symbols. A trap was triggered during their exploration, and an undead priest was awakened. Though victorious, the Goliaths suffered heavy losses in the battle. Amid the ruins, Vrynn discovered an ancient egg, frozen solid in a chamber of ancient ice. While his tribe was weary of it and wanted to crush it, he couldn’t bring himself to let that happen. A connection stirred within him, and he made a choice: to protect the egg at all costs.

  

Fed up with his rejection, and the secrets that had defined his existence, Vrynn chose to leave. That same night, he took the egg and fled into the wilderness, cutting ties with his tribe and their expectations. Now, as a wandering ranger, he carries the weight of his choice, the burden of the dragon egg, and the uncertainty of what comes next as he looks for his missing family. The egg shows faint signs of life, and Vrynn struggles to find meaning as he navigates a world that feels vast, lonely, and full of unanswered questions.
