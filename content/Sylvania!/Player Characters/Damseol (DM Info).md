C# Backstory

Dahlia Rostaeld was born an only child to Delilah and Cedrick Rostaeld, a loving Tiefling couple who had established a comfortable life in the Bosford Empire. Though their home was in the Empire, they often traveled the East continent together, both out of a shared passion for exploration and due to Cedrick’s work as a successful merchant. Their journeys would take them far and wide, sometimes for weeks at a time.

One fateful night, as the family traveled in their caravan, disaster struck. The front wheel, which had been tampered with during their last stop in a town in Baria, broke soon after they set off on their return to the Empire. The damage had been caused by a group of looters who had previously scouted their goods while they were in the city, hoping to make off with something for free. As the caravan veered out of control, Delilah’s lantern fell and shattered, distracting her just long enough to lose focus on her daughter, Dahlia. Taking advantage of the chaos, the looters rushed in and began raiding the caravan. In the confusion, another figure slipped around the back and abducted Dahlia, much to the horror and dismay of Cedrick and Delilah. The mastermind behind the attack was Elisabeth Celik, a human cleric who had received a divine vision from Gotch. In this vision, she was instructed to find and retrieve a particular Tiefling child, for this child was destined for great things— this baby in question being Dahlia. Elisabeth, driven by the vision, took Dahlia back to her homeland, the Principality of Krok’tha, where she renamed her Damseol Celik—an intentional yet subtle nod to her past as a “damsel in distress,” now saved and claimed by Elisabeth.

Damseol's childhood was shaped by her life in the cult community of The United Dawn, where Elisabeth became a mother figure to her. Life within The United Dawn was difficult as the cult was rigidly centered around unity in all aspects of life—from worship to everyday wear to communal meals at "family dinner time." The leadership of The United Dawn’s mission was to take in those who were set aside and outcast from society and to create their own family within their own community, however they held strict views on conformity to keep said “family” together, and any deviation from their ideals was met with harsh punishment. Individuality, rebellion, or self-expression were seen as threats to the unity of the group and were often suppressed with extreme violence, sometimes even murder, which was justified as a form of worship to Gotch—a way to "keep the family together."

As a child, Damseol generally kept to herself, obedient and docile. However, as she grew older, she began to secretly yearn for something more than the monotonous, controlled existence within The United Dawn. Her desire for a different life conflicted with the demands of the cult, but she suppressed these feelings, not wanting to disrupt the sense of unity or bring conflict to her "family." Living with Elisabeth was relatively easy when Damseol followed the rules, but when she didn’t, Elisabeth resorted to corporal punishment to maintain control. Another method of discipline was to hide Damseol’s lantern, an action that often triggered severe panic attacks, especially at night. Elisabeth would downplay the significance of the lantern, guilt-tripping Damseol for her attachment to it and highlighting the fact that no one else in the cult had such a dependency. These moments were emotionally tormenting and over time her resentment for Elisabeth grew, but she buried those feelings, trapped by the fear of being further punished or being cast out.

Growing up in The United Dawn, Damseol stood out, not just because she was the only Tiefling among the demographic of humans, orcs, goblins, and hobgoblins, but also due to her dependence on her lantern and her crippling fear of the dark. The other children would often tease her, mocking her need for the lantern and her different and distinct appearance since it went against the norm. However, there was one child who understood her better than the rest—a human boy named Caleb Fendril. Caleb, unlike the others, recognized the comfort the lantern brought her and sympathized with her needing such comforts as he was a sickly child and had his own ways of seeking comfort during such times of illness and fear himself. Because of this, he would make it a point to stand up for her against such bullies, and over time their friendship blossomed into something deeper, later becoming virtually inseparable. Where one was, the other was sure to follow and life became much easier for Damseol with Caleb by her side. When Damseol and Caleb turned 20, Caleb’s talents in the arcane were recognized by the cult, and he was considered for a position on The United Dawn's council. His prodigious skill and mature wisdom far exceeded his peers, prompting the council to set trials to test his worthiness. By this time, Damseol and Caleb had been secretly involved in a romantic relationship for two years—something that was outright illegal and taboo within The United Dawn, especially given Caleb’s potential council nomination.

As the relationship between the two became more evident, Elisabeth began to notice the growing bond between them. One day, she confronted Damseol about it and a heated argument ensued. In the heat of the moment, Elisabeth revealed her deep regret at having taken Damseol from her original family, describing how Damseol had been nothing but trouble and had shown little gratitude for all Elisabeth had done, including protecting her from being reported to the Uniter’s—the cult’s enforcers—for her many transgressions. Damseol was stunned. She had always believed she was saved from an abusive situation, and now the truth shattered that foundation. In disbelief and anger, she ran away from the argument, seeking comfort in Caleb. She found him during his free time and explained the emotional turmoil she was experiencing, confessing that everything she had known had been upended, and she now wanted to leave the cult. Caleb, however, managed to convince her to stay at least for the evening. He explained that he was about to undergo the council promotion trials and, if successful, might be able to use his new position and the resources it offered to help her. Additionally, Caleb had something personal to share with her that night in private. Torn between her desire to leave and Caleb’s plea, Damseol reluctantly agreed to stay one final night, supporting him through his promotion.

Things took a dramatic turn though during Caleb’s council promotion ceremony when Elisabeth suddenly appeared and revealed to everyone that Caleb and Damseol had been secretly involved in a romantic relationship without any special permissions. The revelation caused an immediate uproar, and the entire facility turned on them. The leadership insisted on using “corrective measures” to realign their thinking for the supposed benefit of the “family.” With the looming threat of punishment and the terrifying prospect of being separated for good, Caleb and Damseol panicked and fled. The Uniters gave chase through the winding halls of their facility. After what felt like an endless chase, the two reached a dead end. The Uniters closed in and, in an attempt to subdue them, fired upon the couple. Unfortunately, one of the shots struck Caleb directly in the chest, delivering a far more lethal blow than intended. In a desperate attempt to escape, Caleb tried to use his magic to blast through the facility wall, but the combination of stress and his injury made it impossible for him to focus properly. His spell misfired, and instead of breaking through the wall it caused the hall to collapse, trapping them both under the rubble with the Uniters still on the other side.

  

As the dust settled, the gravity of Caleb’s injury became clear. He was bleeding out rapidly, and there was nothing they could do to stop it. With no energy and no foreseeable safe way out, Caleb began to express his love for Damseol, urging her to leave The United Dawn. Despite her protests Caleb continued, confessing that he had recently discovered his illness had progressed and that he wouldn’t live much longer, even if he survived the predicament they were in. He explained that his initial plan had been to secure a council position to find a way for both of them to escape the cult—using the resources at his disposal to get them both out. He had kept both his plan and illness secret from her, not wanting to disappoint her should he fail. But now, with his life slipping away, he told Damseol that if it came down to them both staying alive but separated and still trapped, or her escaping alive but without him, he would rather she live a life away from the cult. Caleb then spoke of a ritual within the cult—a special ritual performed when a couple faced one partner’s imminent death. In this ritual, the surviving partner was expected to cannibalize the dying one, symbolizing their undying love and devotion, as well as their commitment to the Dawn Family as it was considered one of the ultimate forms of worship to Gotch. Consuming the flesh and essence of their dying partner would grant the living person the abilities of the deceased. Caleb, weak and fading, expressed his final wish being that he would offer himself as a sacrifice to Damseol to complete this said ritual. After a long back and forth argument and a following painful silence between them, Damseol reluctantly agreed. Despite the horror of the situation, she understood that it was Caleb’s final wish, and she knew there was no other choice. It was an agonizing decision, but in that moment, it was the only way she could honor him as he passed.

  

After completing the ritual, Damseol was overwhelmed by a surge of magical power after absorbing Caleb's abilities, and she unleashed an uncontrollable and massive explosion that shattered the wall behind her that was just enough for her to escape The United Dawn. Once she was far enough away, the weight of everything that had just occurred caught up to her, and she broke down, her emotions unraveling completely. Her distress was so intense that it drew the attention of a fellow Tiefun named Talisun, who used his abilities to peer through her eyes and witness the trauma she had endured over the last few hours. Talisun called out to her, asking for an explanation, and Damseol, desperate for someone to understand, recounted everything. Taking pity on her, Talisun offered her a way to erase the painful memories—but at a cost. He would wipe her memories of the traumatic events in exchange for her sight for a total of  eight hours a day, effectively rendering her totally blind for a portion of the day everyday. Desperate to escape the haunting recollections of her ordeal, Damseol agreed to the pact. With her mind now free of the trauma, she followed Talisun’s guidance and made her way toward the Kiranu States, carrying only her lantern and the few belongings she had left.

  

After weeks of wandering while cold and hungry, Damseol found herself standing outside a busy seamstress shop called The Woven Wish, mesmerized by the elegant dresses displayed in the window. The shop's half orc owner, Ayanna Kimbly, noticed Damseol and felt pity for “such a pretty face being damned to such ugly rags." Ayanna offered her a deal: she would take Damseol in and provide shelter in exchange for her working as both a receptionist and a model for the shop's dresses for upcoming events. Grateful for the offer, Damseol accepted and soon she was living with Ayanna, and the arrangement proved to be a stark contrast to her time with Elisabeth. Living with Ayanna was liberating. Unlike Elisabeth, who had controlled every aspect of Damseol’s life, Ayanna encouraged her to express herself freely in whatever way made her happy. She even involved Damseol in her own artistic projects, and the two bonded over both significant tasks, like completing dresses and running the store together, and smaller more personal moments, such as Ayanna helping Damseol paint her horns and create her own clothes. Three years later, Ayanna overheard a conversation with a customer that piqued her interest—a King from the Eastern continent was offering rewards to anyone who could procure a specific artifact for him. Ayanna shared the information with Damseol, and after some contemplation, Damseol decided to take on the quest, hoping it might lead to answers about Caleb’s fate and the fate of her family. With resolve in her heart, she prepared to journey to Wartontia, leaving behind the life she had rebuilt, but determined to uncover the truth.

  
  
  
  

# Backstory TL;DR

- Was born to a Tiefling couple, Dahlia and Cedrick Rostaelid, in the Bosford Empire, however was kidnapped by a wandering Human Cleric named Elisabeth Celik from a cult located in the Principality of Krok’tha and taken there
    
- Grew up in said cult named The United Dawn with Elisabeth as her mother figure, though cult life would be difficult as they actively suppressed individualism and promoted conformity in everybody being equally the same. Elisabeth would often use both physical and psychological means to punish Damseol if she broke any rules. 
    
- In childhood, she was bullied by children at times because of her crippling fear of the dark and need for her lantern at all times. Caleb Tendril, an often sickly child with an ongoing illness who empathized with her need for comfort while in the throes of fear, would stand up to the other children and became fast friends with her. Over the years this friendship would eventually turn into love and become a relationship which was taboo within the cult unless given special permissions. 
    
- Elisabeth found out and confronted her about her and Caleb’s relationship, and in the heat of the moment revealed her involvement in kidnapping her from her original family, causing her to run away to Caleb and declare her want to leave. Caleb convinced her to stay for the remainder of the night until after his promotion to council member to figure things out and talk. 
    
- Mid promotion, Elisabeth announced Caleb and Damseol’s involvement with each other causing the facility to turn on them. The two run away with the Uniter’s on their heels to apprehend them for punishment. They eventually get found and one shoots Caleb fatally as he attempts to create a passage in a wall but instead creates a cave in. 
    
- Unable to figure any way to feasibly save Caleb, Caleb tells Damseol his dying wish is for her to engage in a cannibalistic ritual that transfers power from himself to her upon completion. She begrudgingly obliges and is able to get out after getting a surge of power from the ritual. A Tiefun named Talisun sees this strife and offers to wipe her memory in exchange for her vision for 8 hours a day. She accepts these terms and agrees to a pact. 
    
-  Weeks after the ordeal, she travels to the Kiranu States outside of a fancy seamstress’ dress store called The Woven Wish and meets a half orc woman named Ayanna Kimbly. She takes pity on her and offers work and a place to stay in return for her to work for her as a model and receptionist. They eventually bond over their love of creatively expressing themselves.
    
- At 23, Ayanna alerts Damseol about a potential way to get information about Caleb and her missing family by procuring an artifact for a king in the other continent. Damseol sets out for this journey to Wartontia. 
    

  

# Knives/Misc. Information

- The United Dawn is a cult whose mission is dedicated to accepting those who were cast out from society and were deemed ultimately unloved. They worship Gotch, God of the Outcasts and Acceptance, and often cite him as the Father of their cult family. All members of the United Dawn are to be perfectly ordinary and equal in the same way from grooming habits to everyday dress and even to communal meals, Because it is their mission to create one like-minded and united community for the sake of peace, those who deviate from the cult’s uniform ideals are quickly found to be dealt with in “corrective measures” as members who practice any form of self expression or individualism are feared to later bring in problematic ideals and potentially break up the community. 
    

- Furthermore, ordinary members are banned from engaging in relationships without explicit permissions from the Dawn Masters as they are believed to be incapable of recognizing optimal compatibility amongst themselves for a truly fruitful relationship and breaking up would cause a disturbance to the family depending on the circumstances. Should a person want to engage in a relationship, they have to be at least 25 years of age and go through a series of special tests, then they are assigned another person who similarly is looking to marry and is deemed to be most compatible with them. Dawn Masters (council members) are prohibited from entering relationships as they dedicate themselves to the family in entirety and are supposed to live celibate lives. 
    

- Damseol has absolutely no memory of what had transpired after Elisabeth outed her and Caleb— her last memory before the ritual was Elisabeth outing them and then jumps to her standing outside in bloodied and torn clothes. She has largely made the assumption that she and Caleb had instead been separated while escaping and has been operating on that assumption alone. She has also assumed that she has made a pact with Talisun in order to find both Caleb and her family; Talisun has confirmed that he is there to aid her, but when the topic of Caleb is brought up he will opt to not comment at all versus when the topic of her family is brought up. 
    
- Despite her having no recollection of the ritual between herself and Caleb, her subconscious still holds the trauma of the incident. As such, she can neither eat cooked nor raw red meat (beef, pork, ox, etc) at all whatsoever as it makes her both violently sick and gives her panic attacks and vivid nightmares. Because of this, she adamantly refuses to eat red meat and will opt for either poultry or seafood— even eating only vegetarian if the only option is red meat
    
- Due to her race descending from Tiefun who have been cursed to be blind, like other Tieflings she also has intense and crippling nyctophobia (fear of the dark). She has her lantern on at all times.   
    
- The hours she agreed to lend her vision to Talisun, or what she calls Blackout hours, are between 9PM and 5AM everyday. 
    
- Living with Ayanna, Damseol has been encouraged to live creatively and unapologetically. She will often sew her own clothes and paint in her free time because of this, and even hand makes stickers for her lantern that she switches out often in accordance to the incoming season and holidays. 
    
- Since she was a kid, Damseol was encouraged to file down her horns by Elisabeth as a way to try to fit in at The United Dawn. She still practices this even now as an adult as apart of her morning and self grooming ritual. 
    
- Damseol likes fancier things and can be usually be more easily bribed to do favors with the promise of particularly nice or fancy things such as items, lodging, food, etc. 
    
- At Ayanna’s suggestion, Damseol exaggerated her position of receptionist on the king’s recruitment flyer and instead put “Business Liason” to sound a bit more professional
    
- Damseol’s favorite type of food is spicy food and favorite flavors are apple and lemon flavors. Her least favorite foods are bitter and over abundantly sweet foods and her least favorite flavor is coconut. 
    

# Relationships

## Cedrick and Delilah Rostaeld

Father and Mother to Damseol respectively

- Unknown: Damseol doesn’t remember her parents because she was kidnapped so young, however the only item of reference she has from them is their family crest on the bottom of her lantern. While she doesn’t know them, she still seeks to set out to find her parents and reunite with them.
    

  

## Elisabeth Celik

Estranged Mother figure from The United Dawn

- Appearance conscious: Elisabeth finds appearances to be extremely important, especially while in the public area. Often times when she is angered, she stays calm and composed in front of others, but has an explosive temper behind closed doors. 
    
- Vindictive: When her wrath has been incurred, she is known to hold grudges and is not against using important personal information about people against them to get a leg up in an argument. 
    
- Willfully ignorant: Once Elisabeth latches onto a particular belief or view, she wholly believes it and refuses to see any rebuttal to her view, even if there is ample evidence against it. 
    

  

## Caleb Fendril

(Deceased) Childhood best friend and lover

- Chronically ill: Since he was a young child, Leon had been fighting with various sicknesses due to his compromised immune system. Later on he’d discover that one of his sicknesses was terminal and he’d only a year or two to live maximum which would partially be the motivation to also want to leave The United Dawn. 
    
- Arcane Prodigy: Growing up he had a fascination with magic and often spent his free time honing his skills in advancing his understanding in them. This would eventually be noticed by the Dawn Masters and fatefully lead to him being nominated for his skill with magic and overall maturity.
    

## Talisun

Tiefun Patron

- Patient: Because of the circumstances that he found Damseol in, he finds himself pitying her and giving her a little extra patience when she decides to go with a decision that he wouldn’t necessarily find himself doing, whereas with other people he might end up insulting their intelligence. He does occasionally find himself in the middle of saying something potentially mean, but does try to make an active effort to catch himself and not do that to her because of his pity. Should she find herself in a situation that is high stress and dangerous that could have been circumvented, he would be likely to get onto her for employing a particularly foolish decision, especially if it was one he warned against. 
    
- Realistic: When asked for an opinion on a particular thing, he doesn’t opt to sugar coat his opinion on whatever is going on but he will still be well spoken about it and tact about the reality of the situation. That being said, because of him also having pacts with other people he isn’t always available for conversation, but when he is available he will occasionally offer insight on something he feels she may need.
    
- Pact Details: As per their pact details, Talisun remains tight lipped when asked about Caleb— not only because of their agreement, but also because he feels guilty about her chasing a ghost essentially and would rather not make an opinion on what occurred. As for his exchange in the deal, blackout hours start from 9PM and last until 5AM everyday. 
    

## Ayanna Kimbly

Adopted Half Orc Mother; Owner of The Woven Wish

- Dramatic: Ayanna is a highly expressive person, almost to a theatrical extent, really. She is very fickle in how she feels and often moves very quickly from one emotion to the next, but no matter what she’s feeling she will ensure to feel every emotion with every fiber of her being to its fullest. 
    
- Aggressively Positive: When giving compliments and general positivity, she is known to be very aggressive with her compliments which can either confuse people and put them off or throughly flatter people. She often uses battle analogies when complimenting people. 
    
- Saleswoman at heart: When having conversations in her shop, no matter the topic she will always try to find a way to goad customers into buying her works; ex. “Sorry to hear you buried your cat, but if you buy this coat you’ll feel like Scruffy never left with how soft this fur is!” 
    

  
  

Goals

- Finding Caleb and her parents
    
- Completing the mission in Wartontia and gaining favor from the king
    
- Coming back to Ayanna with specialty fabrics from other areas of the world

## DM Ideas
	Definitely make this a long lost noble child situation
	Tie in the family crest to the scholar sent to the island?

Ayanna AND Elisabeth AND Cedrick are her connection to the prophecy, but Ayanna was the member of the adventuring party.
