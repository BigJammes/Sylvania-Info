Mira Kythera is a tiefling with a delicate, otherworldly appearance. Her skin is a soft lilac hue, her eyes glow faintly like polished amethysts, and a pair of graceful, curved horns frame her face. She wears flowing robes in deep blues and silvers, often clasped with brooches shaped like celestial symbols. Mira’s past is shrouded in mystery, though rumors suggest she was once a student of a powerful archmage in the far-off island of Amarys. She came to Thult nearly a decade ago, drawn by the magical energies emanating from the island of Essia. Mira founded The Oracle’s Goblet as both an inn and a place of arcane study, attracting scholars and adventurers alike. Known for her serene demeanor and cryptic advice, Mira has earned a reputation as a keeper of secrets and a guide for those who seek knowledge of the unknown.
