Located in a quieter corner of Thult, The Oracle’s Goblet is a mysterious and enchanting inn, favored by mages, scholars, and travelers seeking wisdom. The centerpiece of the establishment is a magical fountain shaped like a goblet, said to grant prophetic dreams to those who drink from it. The walls are lined with glowing runes, shifting softly to form cryptic phrases. The owner, **Mira Kythera**, is a soft-spoken tiefling with deep amethyst eyes and a cloak that seems to shimmer like a starry night. Known for her vast knowledge of arcane lore, Mira often offers guidance to travelers in exchange for rare texts or magical trinkets. The inn is a hub for those on quests tied to ancient mysteries or magical artifacts.
