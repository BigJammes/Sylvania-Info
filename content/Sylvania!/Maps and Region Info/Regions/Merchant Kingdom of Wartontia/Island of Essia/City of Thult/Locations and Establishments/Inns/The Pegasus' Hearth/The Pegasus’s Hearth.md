This lively tavern is a favorite among sailors and adventurers, situated near Thult’s busy docks. The Pegasus’s Hearth is named after the massive carved wooden pegasus head that serves as the centerpiece of its hearth, enchanted to emit soft neighing sounds when a toast is raised. The walls are adorned with trophies from far-off lands, and the air is filled with sea shanties and laughter. The proprietor, **Lykos Persei**, is a half-elf with a weathered face and a mischievous grin. Once a privateer, Lykos has stories for every artifact in the tavern and often entertains patrons with tales of his daring exploits. He also secretly trades in rare goods and rumors from the Sea of Gold.
