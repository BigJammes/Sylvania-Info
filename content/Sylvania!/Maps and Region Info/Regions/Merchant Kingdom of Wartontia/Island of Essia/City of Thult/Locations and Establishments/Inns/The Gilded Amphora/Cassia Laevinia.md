![[7af3e9f9-bbac-46ee-91dd-75f2e1a74433.webp]]Cassia Laevinia is a striking human woman in her late thirties, with sleek, jet-black hair styled in intricate braids, olive-toned skin, and sharp hazel eyes that rarely miss a detail. She wears elegant gowns adorned with subtle gold embroidery, reflecting the refined taste of her establishment. Born into a family of merchants in the heart of Thult, Cassia honed her skills in negotiation and charm from a young age. After inheriting a small fortune, she poured her resources into transforming The Gilded Amphora into the town’s most prestigious inn. Though she presents herself as a gracious hostess, Cassia’s ambition runs deep; she’s known to subtly manipulate her guests to secure alliances and ensure the success of her business. Beneath her polished exterior lies a steely determination to rise above her origins and solidify her place among Thult’s elite.
