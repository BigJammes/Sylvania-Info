Lykos Persei is a weathered half-elf with tanned skin, sea-green eyes, and shoulder-length sandy hair that’s often tied back in a loose braid. His arms bear faded tattoos of sea creatures and constellations, mementos of his days as a privateer. Once a sailor in the Sea of Gold, Lykos gained a reputation as both a daring captain and a charming rogue, skirting the line between hero and outlaw. After a fateful encounter with a leviathan that sank his ship and scattered his crew, he retired to Thult and opened The Pegasus’s Hearth. Despite his rough exterior and roguish demeanor, Lykos is deeply loyal to his patrons and views his tavern as a sanctuary for wanderers and outcasts. His connections to the underworld occasionally surface, as Lykos trades in whispers of danger and opportunity for those bold enough to seek them.
