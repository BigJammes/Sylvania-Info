Located on the outskirts of Thult’s marketplace, **Crafios’ Forge** is a renowned blacksmith shop where the clang of hammer on metal is heard day and night. The forge, named after the god of craftsmanship, boasts a large, enchanted anvil that glows with ethereal fire. Weapons, armor, and tools crafted here are famous for their unparalleled quality, often inscribed with ancient runes of protection. The shop is run by **Thalios Pyris**, a grizzled human blacksmith with a thick beard and hands calloused from years of labor. Thalios was once a wandering craftsman who learned his trade from dwarven masters in the far west. Now, he specializes in melding magic with metal, creating legendary items that are sought after by adventurers and nobles alike. His shop is filled with the scent of hot iron, smoke, and the faint hum of magical energy.
