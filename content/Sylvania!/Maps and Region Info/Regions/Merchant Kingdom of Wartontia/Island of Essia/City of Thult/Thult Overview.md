## New Thult
Spanning a large majority of Thult's expanse, New Thult is the home of the bustling day to day life of many of the residents of the city. Build over the course of the past 200 years since the purchase of the island, the district boasts far newer architecture and more efficient city planning for what is now the largest city in the Sea of Gold. If you're a traveler or a resident chances are you will likely be living your life within the bounds of this district.

## Old Thult
Founded almost 1000 years prior during the first large scale settlementations of the western regions, Thult originally only consisted of a small city which served to house many of the explorers and adventurers venturing westward during this period. The city's architecture is old in style but aptly maintained by the local masonry guilds and the original district still hold vital importance to the more populated and far newer New Thult. Old Thult hosts plenty of historical venues as well as Inns and Shops.

## Thult Merchant District

Wanna buy imported weapons? How about some exotic spices? Perhaps a new suit for that important trade deal you're negotiating? If you need it the Merchant District of Thult likely has it. This single district often has more money flow through it on a given day than the rest of the entire island combined. People from all walks of life and regions of the world gather in this district during their stay in Thult to buy and sell services and goods galore.

## Blue Quarter
The Intellectual district. Two main universities are located here, the Thult University of Magical Study and Applications, and the Thult Military Academy. There are also a plethora of libraries, theaters, and other options for upper class entertainment located here. Some of the most famous playwrights and performers of the century tested their newest material here. Currently only some classes are actively accepting students due to the turmoil on the rest of the island.

## Red Quarter
The home of the city's guards and stationed garrison. The Thultian Guardsmen are quite skilled and plenty capable of maintaining peace within the walls. The issue however is the rest of the island, which as of late has been completely overrun by various pirate and reaver factions hunting for the artifact within the ancient crypts of the island. Due to this, the island's guards have almost entirely moved to strictly defending the city and have mostly left the rest of the island to fend for itself.

## Green Quarter
Roughly 60% of the city's food supply comes from the vast farmland that is owned and harvested by the residents of this district. Located just outside of the southeastern wall, the majority of the people here are somewhat poor compared to the rest of the city, but despite that still enjoy quite a high quality of life due to the sheer amount of wealth the city has.

## Docks
The docks of Thult have three main sections The Cherry Docks, Centerport, and the Northern Docks. All three have their purposes, the Cherry docks take in the majority of trade ships as well as any diplomatic envoys. Centerport takes in most if not all of the travelers that pass through Thult. Finally, the Northern Docks host the city's fishing boats as well as the Navy, which is made up of 7 warships and 22 light frigates.
