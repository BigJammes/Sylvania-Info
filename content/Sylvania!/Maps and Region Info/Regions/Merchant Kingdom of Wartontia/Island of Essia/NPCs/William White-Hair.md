# Physical Description
William White-Hair is a dashing young pirate with an air of charisma as sharp as his blade. His signature platinum-blond hair, always slightly windswept, gives him a striking appearance that matches his larger-than-life reputation.

# Summary
Dressed in flamboyant silks and adorned with glittering trinkets looted from his exploits, William’s every movement exudes confidence. Renowned across the seas for his unmatched swordsmanship and legendary revelries, he’s as much a thrill-seeker as he is a treasure hunter. Recently, he has set his sights on the island of Essia, drawn by tales of a mythical artifact said to grant unimaginable power. Though his motivations are shrouded in bravado and charm, whispers among his crew suggest a deeper, more personal reason behind his relentless quest for dominance.
