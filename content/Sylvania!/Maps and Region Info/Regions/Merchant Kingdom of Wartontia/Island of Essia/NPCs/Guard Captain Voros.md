# Physical Description
Voros is a tall, imposing half-orc with a muscular frame, green-tinged skin, and sharp tusks that protrude from his lower jaw. His dark hair is kept short, and his piercing yellow eyes are always alert, scanning his surroundings with a keen, tactical mind. Wearing a mix of polished armor and weathered leather, Voros exudes authority, his presence commanding respect from both his subordinates and the people of Thult

# Summary
Born to an orcish warrior and a human merchant, he grew up between two worlds, using his natural strength to defend his family’s trade routes while learning the nuances of diplomacy and city governance. Over the past decade, Voros has risen through the ranks of the city’s guard, becoming the trusted captain of the garrison. He now oversees the security of Thult and its surrounding towns, often leading expeditions to deal with raiders or pirates threatening the islands. His past has been marked by a fierce determination to prove his worth, both to his city and to himself, as he navigates the complexities of his dual heritage.
