# Physical Description
Meri Cold-Bones is a lithe and elegant elven scholar with silvery-white hair tied in intricate braids, skin as pale as moonlight, and sharp, piercing blue eyes that seem to carry the weight of centuries.

# Summary
Once a member of a prestigious aristocratic family, she left the comforts of noble life to pursue her passion for uncovering the mysteries of Sylvania's ancient ruins. A devoted historian and arcane linguist, Meri has spent the last decade piecing together fragments of a long-lost civilization, her relentless drive fueled by whispers of forgotten magic. These ventures have recently culminated in her travelling to the island of Essia. Her nickname, Cold-Bones, reflects both her unyielding demeanor and her tendency to venture into treacherous, frostbitten terrains for her research. While she projects an air of cool detachment, Meriâ€™s true warmth lies in her fascination with the stories of the past and the secrets they might yet reveal.
