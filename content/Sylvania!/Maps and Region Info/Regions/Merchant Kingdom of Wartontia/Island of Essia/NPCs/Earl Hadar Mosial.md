# Physical Description
Hadar Mosial, the esteemed earl of Thult, is a middle-aged man with dark brown hair neatly combed back, a weathered face marked by years of responsibility, and deep-set hazel eyes that hold a spark of resilience. His commanding presence is complemented by his practical yet noble attire, reflecting both his status and his dedication to his people.

# Summary
Elected as earl two decades ago, Hadar has created a second resurgence of Thult into a thriving port city once again, renowned as the largest merchant hub in the Sea of Gold. However, recent years have tested his mettle as an artifact unearthed on Essia has drawn the attention of ruthless pirates and reaver bands, sparking relentless raids. Struggling to maintain order and protect his city, Hadar has taken a more hands-on approach to leadership, meeting with captains, merchants, and defenders daily to strategize against the growing threat. Beneath his composed exterior lies a man burdened by the weight of his city’s future and the growing shadow of the artifact’s influence.
