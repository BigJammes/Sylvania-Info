# Physical Description


# Summary
King Marcus Thult II is the current ruler of the Merchant Kingdom of Wartontia and is 65 years old. He is also the only ruler *ever* to be elected as the son of a previous ruler (Queen Helia Thult). Similar to his mother, Marcus has enjoyed a relatively peaceful rule, with only one major war during his reign. Due to this he is quite popular with the kingdom's populace, and many are confident he will solve the issues placating the Island of Essia.
